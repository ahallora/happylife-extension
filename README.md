# Happy Life - Website blocker extension for Chrome
The world has gone mad and social media, news and political blogs are part of the problem. With this extension you can block out the websites your sane self deem the most harmful for your mental health. Stay safe and pursue happiness. 

## Installation

1. Download repo and unpack repo to a folder
2. Go to `chrome://extensions`
3. Click `Load unpacked` button and select the unpacked folder
4. Start the extension and add some unhealthy websites
5. Enjoy a happier (and maybe more ignorant) life. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•

## How does it work?
The extension saves the list of websites to your chrome profile, so if you install this extension on other devices it should work too without requiring you to setup the blacklist again. I don't know though, haven't tested it. You go and tell me if it works. And if it doesn't, don't be rude but do the work and submit a pull request fixing things. Or accept that it just doesn't work and move on with your life. I don't know. I'm not your dad. Live your life the best you can - all I can do is help you pursue happieness. I ain't much but it's honest work.
